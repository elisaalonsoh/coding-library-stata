    "# Welcome to my Stata Coding Library\n",
    "\n",
    "This is my personal collection of Stata templates (.do) and a mix of explanations and code snippets (in jupyter notebooks). I personally use VS code to edit my files because it has a great syntax completition features, and you can run Stata inside Jupyter Notebooks using [stata-kernel](https://kylebarron.dev/stata_kernel/).\n",
    "\n",
    "The core part of the library focuses on **tables** and **graphs**, which aim to automatically create *latex* output from the dofile. There are many ways to do create tables in *Stata*, and I include several of them while providing a short summary of why I prefer a certain way (usuallly it all boils down to code complexity vs customizability). As a sneak peak, I think 95% of what you will need to present can be done using some neat commands/packages, but knowing how to do it manually is useful for that frustating 5% left. \n",
    "\n",
    "This table of contents shows the basic structure of the library, but since it is in its super early stages, it is likely to change as I understand how I want to search/find content better at a later date. For now, I am grouping things based on whether they deal with data preparation, descriptives, or main analysis (further divided by types of research design). \n",
