    "Sometimes we want to have a balanced panel even if the variables of interest are missing (or later recoded as 0, or some value), but not all periods appear in our dataset. Once we have `xtset` our data, we can use the command `tsfill` to create the new missing time periods for each of our ids (it can also be used with only time data)."
